# Hello, I'm Merve Kıratlı! 👋

## 🏗️ Architect | 💻 Software Developer | 🔗 Bridging Design & Code

> *Where architectural thinking meets software engineering — building solutions that understand both the problem domain and the technical implementation.*

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I develop **engineering-focused software** by combining **architectural domain expertise** with **modern .NET development practices**. My background in BIM workflows and parametric design informs how I architect software systems — structured, scalable, and user-centric.

### Current Focus
- **BIM-inspired software development** (structural design tools, 3D visualization)
- **Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design** for engineering applications
- **Bridging the gap** between architects/engineers and software teams

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Backend Development**
- C# | .NET 8 | ASP.NET Core | Web API | Entity Framework Core
- Clean Architecture | Repository Pattern | MVVM | Dependency Injection

**Desktop Applications**
- WPF | XAML | HelixToolkit (3D rendering) | MaterialDesign

**Database & Tools**
- SQL Server | Git | AutoMapper | FluentValidation | xUnit

**BIM & Design Expertise**
- Autodesk Revit | Rhino | Grasshopper | IFC Standards
- Parametric Design | 3D Modeling | Rendering (Enscape, D5, Lumion)

## 💡 What Makes Me Different

### Architectural Thinking Applied to Code

```
Architecture Education → Software Development

🏗️ Parametric Design        →  Generic Patterns & Abstractions
🏗️ Multi-disciplinary Coord  →  Clean Architecture Layers
🏗️ BIM Workflows             →  Domain-Driven Design
🏗️ 3D Spatial Reasoning      →  Data Structure Optimization
🏗️ Technical Documentation   →  Self-Documenting Code
```

### Real-World Impact
- **4 years** intensive Revit/BIM experience in professional practice
- **3 years** freelance architectural projects (coordination with engineers)
- **2nd Place** — İTÜ "Design Together with BIM 2020" (multi-disciplinary team)
- **Fast learner:** Architecture → Software in 8 months (while maintaining quality)
